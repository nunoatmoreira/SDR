    "The DFT is a mathematicla procedure used to determine the harmonic or frequency, content of a discrete signal sequence. Although, for our purposes, a discrete signal is a set of values obtained by periodic sampling of a continuous signal in the time domain, we'll find that the DFT is useful in analyzing any discrete sequences regardless of what that sequence actually represents. The DFT's origin, of course, is the continuous Fourier transform $X(f)$ defined as \n",

The value N is an important parameter because it determines how many input samples are needed, the resolution of the frequency-domain results, and the amount of processing time necessary to calculate an N-point DFT.\n",

    "The pattern in Eq. 3-4b through 3-4e is apparent now, and we can certainly see why it's convenient to use the summation sign in Eq. 3-3. Each X(m) DFT output term is the sum of the point for point product between an input sequence of signal values and a complex sinusoid of the form $\\cos(\\phi)-j\\sin(\\phi)$. The exact frequencies of the different sinusoids depend on both the sampling rate $f_s$, at which the original signal was sampled, and the number of samples N. For example, if we are sampling a continuous signal at a rate of 500 samples/s and then perform a 16-point DFT on the sample data, the fundamental frequency of the sinusoids is $f_s/N =500/16$ or 31.25Hz.
